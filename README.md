Coding Samples

This a set of 3 different coding samples from my past work involving matlab, Swift, and C.

The first project is the work I did in Swift during my time with the Brain Trauma Assessement Protocols 
research group in order to create an iOS application. The different swift files represent the work I did in
data collection techniques after each session and the individual modules I programmed to detect specific forms of brain trauma.

The second project is the work I did with the TI CC3200 in order to program the chip to communicate with an http server and receive
a JSON file that is to be parsed. Most of the framework comes from TI's tutorial library with the chip, but my work goes on to
retrieve and process data from the server. 

The third project is the work I did in one of my DSP classes in Matlab. The Matlab work involves assignments in which I was required to
develop an adaptive filtering algorithm and also create a dialtone decoder that was laced with noise.
